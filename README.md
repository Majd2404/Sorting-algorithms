# In Ruby, you can implement various sorting algorithms, each with its own time complexity. 
# Here are some common sorting algorithms in Ruby along with their time complexities:

### Bubble Sort:

Time Complexity:
+ Worst Case: O(n^2)
+ Best Case: O(n) (when the list is already sorted)
+ Average Case: O(n^2)

### Insertion Sort:

Time Complexity:
+ Worst Case: O(n^2)
+ Best Case: O(n) (when the list is almost sorted)
+ Average Case: O(n^2)

### Merge Sort:

Time Complexity:
+ Worst Case: O(n log n)
+ Best Case: O(n log n)
+ Average Case: O(n log n)

### Quick Sort:

Time Complexity:
+ Worst Case: O(n^2)
+ Best Case: O(n log n)
+ Average Case: O(n log n)
